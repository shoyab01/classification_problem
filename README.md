# classification_problem
An insurance company has provided Health Insurance to its customers and  now the company needs help in building a model to predict whether the  policyholders(customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle  Insurance provided by the company.

In this project, I have also demonstrated Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).

# Business Goal
Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance, I have been provided the information about demographics(gender, age, region code type), Vehicles(Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy(Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains 381109 rows and 12 columns with 11 features namely id, Gender, Age, Driving_License, Region_Code, Previously_Insured, Vehicle_Age, Vehicle_Damage, Annual_Premium, Policy_Sales_Channel, Vintage, Response. 

This is a classification problem. By using Random forest classifier, I have predicted whether the previously insured customers are again interested in the policy or not.
